current:

features:
- knight's path
- create settings menu
- global high-score

fixes:
- recompute if the first click is a bomb
- precompute the numbers (after the first click?)
- stop the timer (right now i am just not calling render anymore)
- separate update loop for the settings-menu
- put the other stuff into init() (because of the settings-menu)

refactoring:
- put that gigantic iterator into a separate function
- I think there is a few places where I used get_rect() because i
  didn't know that get_size(), get_width() and get_height() existed.
- make bigger sprites for the buttons (don't just scale them up)
- rename the sprites (not just single characters)
- make the settings menu a new class (and put it into another module?)
- put the settings into a new module (config.py) then use
  'import * from config'.
